# ReoNa – Lost

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Cut my hair
just because I thought that
maybe things would change
Laughing at
me and the things you see
Tell me who's to blame？
Falls to the ground, floating
Just like gold dust
it's sparkling
Taking me back to the start
My spirits are darkening
It makes me feel so weak
Looking for a reason why
I can't comprehend
I feel the lightness in my head
Now my thoughts are
clouded by strange things I see
For every breath
I take every day
Every drop of blood, every stain
Like the moon
I will wax and wane
Circle's complete
For all the promises that I keep
All the nights
when I can't sleep
Every time that I held your hand
Iician far gesund gemynd
Shake of the hand,
another demand
but what does it mean？
Cry through the pain,
it's always the same
Will it ever heal？
Though broken bones
and the wounds I bear,
they may heal one day
Somewhere inside
there's an empty place
and a price to pay
Hiding from the flicker
of the light before dawn
I turn away and close my eyes
Gonna hold back tears
'til the sadness is gone
Until the fever will dissipate
'til I know how I feel today
Gonna rise up to meet my fate
Circle’s complete
For all the times
you've been by my side
All the good times
that pass us by
If I can't find you in the dark
Iician far gesund gemynd
Sometimes words they fade away
The meaning
gets lost in the dark
Just learn to let go,
the past is gone
You never
know what the future holds
Sand in my toes,
I walk all alone
on this lonely shore
Deep in the darkness,
a vision so fine
It's beautiful
A sudden stop, then I realize
Turn around, now I wanna cry
I have found
where the secrets lie
I see it now
I wave a hand
to the brand new day
And the pain has all gone away
These new feelings
that love betrays
I sing a song so sweet,
someone in need
A song for someone who has
come to the end of the line
